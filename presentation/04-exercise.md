## Putting it all together
Use the provided sample project and benchmark both sequential number generators to determine how many operations per
time unit (e.g. micros) each of them can handle. Feel free to play around with the iterations/durations.

### Cheat Codes
1. `git checkout benchmark_setup_gradle` for the gradle setup code
2. `git checkout benchmark_setup_generators` for the benchmark code
